                Despite being mentally unstable and sometimes distracted, Harley is highly intelligent. Her intellect
                extends to her psychological, tactical and deception abilities, but she does not stand out for
                particular strategic or scientific skills and often remains subordinate to the Joker, who between the
                two is the genius and the inventor. Harleen Quinzel earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and as a
                former Arkham psychiatrist, was highly qualified in psychoanalysis, criminology, and forensic
                psychiatry.

                While not on par with Joker, she is still an expert tactician, deceiver and escapologist,
                and still shows traces of her psychological experience. Harley Quinn is the only person besides the
                Joker to concoct Joker Venom, the Joker's signature weapon, and is shown to have reverse-engineered its
                formula and developed an antitoxin. She also has an indomitable pathological will.

                Harley Quinn has no superpowers, and relies on her unpredictability, gymnastics skills, and weapons and
                hand-to-hand proficiency. She is a peak athlete, having won a gymnastics scholarship at Gotham City's
                Gotham State University. Following her transition to main DC canon in 1999, Harley Quinn was established
                as having immunity to toxins and enhanced strength, agility, durability, and reflexes, which she
                received after having been injected a serum concocted by Poison Ivy. "Vengeance Unlimited, Part Five"
                (Harley Quinn vol. 1 #30) revealed that it also gave her the ability to breathe underwater
