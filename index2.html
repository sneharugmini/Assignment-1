                Harley Quinn is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Quinn was created
                by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm as a comic relief henchwoman for the supervillain Joker in Batman. She is 31
                years old and her hobbies include games and puzzles.

                Originally a career-oriented psychologist, Dr. Harleen Quinzel's life took a radical turn when she chose
                to take an internship at Arkham Asylum for a semester of college. Convinced by the Joker himself to do
                it, Harleen interviewed him and learned he was abused as a child by his alcoholic father (later learning
                this backstory to have been one of several different stories he had told to others, some with different
                details each time), and after more interviews, determined Batman was the primary source of the Joker's
                anger and was to blame for his actions, but that she also had fallen in love with him. Harleen helped
                the Joker escape and, renaming herself Harley Quinn, became his sidekick in hopes that she could win his
                love, going on a crime spree across the United States of America.
